    "question": "Why won't my ECU start? Is it locked?",
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "answer": "Likely cause: All Link ECUs are shipped locked. When locked, the ECU can be installed and configured in PCLink, but it will not read engine RPM or run the engine. If your engine won’t start, the ECU is likely still locked.\n\nHow to resolve:\n1) Install PCLink:\n   - Download the latest PCLink from linkecu.com (USB drivers are included).\n2) Connect to the ECU:\n   - Connection is via the ECU’s on-board interface:\n     - G5 Voodoo Neo: USB, Ethernet, or Wi‑Fi\n     - G5 Voodoo Pro: USB or Wi‑Fi\n     - G4X / G4+: USB\n   - In PCLink, press F1 to open Help for connection instructions.\n3) Update firmware:\n   - Once connected, check ECU firmware and upgrade to the latest version.\n4) Unlock the ECU:\n   - Contact your official Link ECU supplier to obtain an unlock code.\n   - Use the provided unlock code to unlock the ECU. Until unlocked, the ECU will not read RPM or run the engine.\n\nSupport options:\n- PCLink Help — press F1 while running PCLink.\n- Link website: linkecu.com\n- Contact your nearest Link dealer (list on linkecu.com)\n- Technical Support: tech@linkecu.com\n- Forums: linkecu.com/forums",

    "question": "What’s the difference between AUX and Injection outputs?",
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "answer": "Safety warning:\n- Using the wrong output type for a load can damage the ECU or the actuator. Confirm each channel’s drive type (low-side vs high-side), PWM capability, and any special requirements before wiring. Note that some Aux channels are low-side only, some provide high/low-side drive, and certain functions (e-throttle motor) require specific Aux channels or an external controller.\n\nDifference between AUX and Injection outputs:\n\n1) Primary purpose\n- Injection outputs:\n  - Dedicated to controlling fuel injectors.\n  - Wiring: “Wire Inj 1 to cyl 1, 2 to 2, 3 to 3, etc...”\n  - Example hardware note: “Inj 1+ supplies the positive side of injectors… Injection 1A switches the negative sides of four injectors” (i.e., negative-side switching).\n- Auxiliary (Aux) outputs:\n  - General-purpose control of actuators such as solenoids, relays, valves, and motors.\n  - Support functions including high-frequency PWM, VVT control, idle control (ISC), stepper ISC, alternator control, and (on specific channels) e-throttle motor.\n\n2) Electrical/functional capability\n- Injection outputs:\n  - Intended as injector drivers; negative-side switching is referenced in the documentation.\n  - Use as general switching varies by ECU/version:\n    - One note states: “Use spare Injection channels for switching type Auxiliary Outputs.”\n    - Another installer table states: “Spare Injection Channels unavailable for switching.”\n    - Conclusion: Whether spare injection outputs can be used for switching is ECU-dependent and must be confirmed for the specific model.\n- Auxiliary outputs:\n  - Designed as “flywheeled” drivers for inductive loads.\n  - Channel capabilities vary:\n    - Aux 1: High-frequency PWM or VVT control; low-side only. “Three Wire ISC Solenoid must be wired to Aux1 and Aux2.”\n    - Aux 5: PWM < 300 Hz or general switching; “Flywheeled, High / Low side Drives; ISC Stepper (4 or 6 terminal).”\n    - Aux 8: Alternator control (switched output providing ~13 V active low vs ~14.5 V off).\n    - Aux 9 (E-throttle Motor +) and Aux 10 (E-throttle Motor -): For e-throttle motor or GP output.\n    - Model-specific note (MX5Link): Aux 9 & 10 are not exposed; to use e-throttle, use Aux 1 & 2 with an external e-throttle controller.\n\nSummary:\n- Injection outputs are primarily dedicated low-side drivers for fuel injectors and must be assigned to cylinders; using them for switching depends on the specific ECU documentation.\n- Aux outputs are general-purpose, flywheeled drivers with PWM/varying drive types, intended for solenoids, stepper/idle valves, alternator control, and (on specific channels) e-throttle motors.",

Connect your laptop to the ECU and open PCLink.\n2. Under Analog Channels, select the An Volt channel that the MAP sensor is wired to.\n3. Select the correct MAP Sensor Type.\n4. Go to Options and select MAP sensor calibration, then follow the on‑screen instructions.\n5. Open the Runtime Values pane (lower part of the screen) and select the Analog Inputs tab.\n6. Verify MAP and BAP values are similar (within 1 kPa) at atmosphere.\n7. Press F4 to Store the settings.\n\nFor more detail: PCLink G4X Users Manual -> Tuning Operating Procedures -> ECU Controls -> MAP Sensor Calibration.\n\nIf your issue is with a different sensor (e.g., TPS or IAT), I'm sorry, I couldn't find this in the current documentation.",

Flywheeled, low-side only.\n  - Aux 5 (and related group per context): PWM less than 300 Hz or general switching functions; flywheeled; high/low side drives; supports ISC stepper (4 or 6 terminal).\n  - Aux 8: Alternator control; switched output to select between two charging voltages (~13 V when output ON active-low, ~14.5 V when OFF). Use a GP Output strategy for control.\n  - Aux 9/10: E-throttle motor +/− (where available). Note: On MX5Link, Aux 9 & 10 are not exposed; to use E-throttle you must use Aux 1 & 2 with an external E-throttle controller.\n- Notes: Many AUX outputs are “flywheeled” (inductive load suppression) and may be low-side only or support high/low side depending on the specific AUX channel.\n\nSummary\n- Injection outputs are primarily for injectors, with defined injector power feeds and low-side switching.\n- AUX outputs are designed for a wide range of actuators with defined PWM/switching capabilities and protection features.\n- Whether spare Injection channels can be used as AUX depends on the specific ECU documentation for that model.",

Pin A6 (ignition switch input) must be connected to a switched battery source. Do not connect A6 to constant VBat unless you accept the ECU will remain powered.\n3. If you require the H‑Bridge/AUX drivers (AUX3/4/HB1 and AUX5/6/HB2), ensure Pin B5 is supplied with VBat — these drivers will not function if B5 is unpowered.\n4. For CAN devices: CAN 1 provides a +14V 3A continuous power output from the ECU (suitable to power a CAN Lambda).\n5.
