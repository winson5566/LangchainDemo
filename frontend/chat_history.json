Also i tried swithing the dip switch and my 1999 wrx is a jdm\n\nYes engine will not start when the ecu is locked.  Triggers will be disabled.\n\nOk thanks good to know ty for the help ill just wait for my unlock code\n\nReply to this topic...\n×\nPasted as rich text.\nPaste as plain text instead\nOnly 75 emoji are allowed.\n×\nYour link has been automatically embedded.\nDisplay as a link instead\n×\nYour previous content has been restored.\nClear editor\n×\nYou cannot paste images directly.

Specific auxiliary outputs are optimized for different functions (e.g., Aux 1 for High Frequency PWM, Aux 5 for PWM less than 300 Hz and ISC Stepper, Aux 9/10 for E-throttle).\n\n3.  **Electrical Characteristics:**\n    *   **Injection Outputs:**\n        *   Typically switch the negative side (low-side drive) of the connected component.\n        *   Forum posts indicate that injector drives do not have internal pull-up resistors.\n    *   **Auxiliary Outputs:**\n        *   Can be low-side, high/low side, or high-side drives depending on the specific output (e.g., Aux 1 is low-side, Aux 5 is high/low side, Aux 14 is high-side for VTEC Solenoid).\n        *   Forum posts state that auxiliary outputs typically have a 12V pull-up when off.",

I did suspect something like that as I could not find any info. So it must use either pin 56 or 66 . Ill have to check the mpi relay diagram..Im not using the factory relay any more as I have a custom relay setup. I can just find the pin and wire it to the new relay for the isc to keep it active to reset . Ill just wire fans to the AC trig.\n\nI have a couple other questions also. I have removed the power transistor for the factory coils as im going to run a direct fire coil on plug system , so I have lost the factory tacho output and was told to run a relay triggered by ecu ( with contacts removed ) parallel to an Aux output set for tacho to create the voltage needed to drive factory tacho. Do i need to run a resistor inline to the relay coil ground?\nAlso , the AUX settings have a high and low setting . Is this to change between a pos and neg trigger?\n\n11 hours ago, ozyvr4 said:\nSo it must use either pin 56 or 66\nInj6 grounds pin 63 & 66 to power up the mpi relay and associated circuit.\n8 hours ago, ozyvr4 said:\nAlso , the AUX settings have a high and low setting . Is this to change between a pos and neg trigger?\nThe high/low polarity settings on aux outputs is to invert the behaviour.  Polarity low will output a ground when on.  Polarity high will be grounded when off.  On some auxes you will also have a highside/lowside drive setting, this is irrelevant on the VR4 ecu as it only has lowside drives fitted.\n8 hours ago, ozyvr4 said:\nI have a couple other questions also.

Do i need to run a resistor inline to the relay coil ground?\nIf you have a spare injector or ignition drive to drive the relay then it will work without anything extra, just connect the relay coil parrallel to the tacho.  If you only have an auxiliary output then you may find the flyback diode will prevent the relay from doing its job, you will have to use an extra transistor like the circuit you will find all over the net in this case.\n\nThanks that some great insite to how it all works. I went over the mpi relay schematics and saw how it works. I will keep it as normal on inj 6 and swap my fuel pump to an AUX trig and use the injec 5 for the tacho. At the moment the AC does not work so ill use that output to drive fans.\nIve added some pics of the harness and the coil setup as this is totally different than a stock setup.\n\nReply to this topic...\n×\nPasted as rich text.\nPaste as plain text instead\nOnly 75 emoji are allowed.\n×\nYour link has been automatically embedded.\nDisplay as a link instead\n×\nYour previous content has been restored.\nClear editor\n×\nYou cannot paste images directly.

I'm running an atom on my build and have basically run out of I/O.\nI have been told about the CAN Aux feature, and am wanting to run a boost control solenoid off it.\nMy understanding of a bus like this is that each device has the bus protocol and its own address so it works in turn on the bus.\nSo I can understand how CAN devices like screens, lambda etc can run on the bus, but what I can't understand is how a \"dumb\" device like a bcs could run off the bus. Is it even possible or have I been told wrong?\nThanks in advance.\n\nFor most CAN expansions, the aux outputs are basic low current on/off triggers that cannot drive PWM...\nUnless the CAN expansion is a PDM (power distribution module) --- which would be overkill for what you just intended.\nYou can assign the boost control solenoid on one of the AtomX's aux output for PWM, and then whatever you have there before that's just triggered on/off can be re-assigned to a CAN aux of something like ECUMaster CAN Switch Board V3.\n\nWhat engine?  If a 4 cyl direct spark you could possibly rewire the coils to wasted spark to free up 2 ignition outputs?\n\nHi adam, thanks.\nIt's an Ej20 and I'm already on wasted spark. I'm sequential injection but I don't want to go batch fire.\nFrom memory my outputs, including the two free injector channels are\nFuel pump\nCel\nFan\nTacho\nI can't remember the other two but I'm sure I've got six and used them all. Nothing funky, just standard stuff.\nI was thinking I could run the fuel pump off a switch to free up an aux.\nBut I'm really curious if the CAN bus run an aux device like a bcs. It mentions it in the link help file but is pretty brief and I reckon I'm misunderstanding it.\nCheers.\nEssboo, thanks.\nSo could I drive the tacho or fuel pump relay for example from a CAN aux?\nIm still confused as to how the can aux's control \"dumb\" components.\nThanks.\n\nTacho also has to be driven by PWM, basic fuel pump relay can be driven by CAN aux --- but since that is something critical that would cause a no-go whenever there's something up with the CAN switchboard or the CAN bus itself, I would personally want that driven by ECU aux.\n\nA \"CAN aux\" is just a piece of data in a CAN message that is sent to some other device.  So to make that into a real output that can drive a solenoid, you would need a CAN device that has outputs.  There arent too many low cost options that are capable of PWM control of a solenoid, most would be PDM type devices or \"IO expanders\".\nOne example:\nhttps://mectricmse.com/en-nz/products/µpdm4-rev3\n\nThanks Adam and Ess, that's pretty much the answer I was looking for.\nFor it to work like I was told sounded like some kind of magic! What you guys have said is much closer to what I thought a data bus could do.\nI might just put my fuel pump on a switch and use that aux for the boost control.\nThanks again.\n\nReply to this topic...\n×\nPasted as rich text.\nPaste as plain text instead\nOnly 75 emoji are allowed.\n×\nYour link has been automatically embedded.\nDisplay as a link instead\n×\nYour previous content has been restored.\nClear editor\n×\nYou cannot paste images directly.

        "content": "Hi,\nNeed help to clarify if the AUX/INJ/IGN spare output can be use to provide 5V PWM output to external controller? if yes can it be set internally or via external pull-up resistor to 5V?\n\nThey are low side drive.  The aux outputs have a 12V pull-up so will be pulled up to 12V when off.  ign and injector drives dont have pull-ups so you could add your own 5V pull-up into the wiring if you really needed 5V.  If it is a PWM device however it probably doesnt care what voltage is used - as the name suggests it is using pulse width, not voltage.\n\n@Adamw\nIm feeding signals to toyota/daihatsu EPS to avoid it from running in safe mode. The ECU that im using is XtremeX wire-in.\nCurrently I identified 2 signals required (both 50% duty cycle signals) from factory service manual of that EPS.\nSpeed: 5V square wave (~17Hz at 20kph) confirmed can use 5V pull-up from INJ/IGN) - not sure if the controller can accept >5V high signal. I'm just try to be safe and feed 5V square signal.\nRPM: 12V square wave (~33Hz at 1000rpm) for 4 piston\nso if im using AUX for engine speed (RPM), regardless of which AUX (1-8) we should be able to get 12V high (pulled to 12V internally) and 0v low since it is low side drive? Am i right?\n\nAre you already outputting a tacho signal to the factory dash? Do you still have the factory dash and is it outputting a speed signal still?\nBased on dealing with Toyotas previously you should just be able to use the regular Aux outputs\n\n@Vaughan\nNope im not sending tacho output to factory dash. Dash is AIM, which the input is from CAN bus. For speed signal the output come straight from Xtreme ECU to the EPS. So does the EPS controller can accept 12V signal with no issue for speed?\n\nI have never used an EPS controller so can't say with any real certainty that it will accept the speed and tacho signal directly from the ECU but I would definitely recommend trying it and seeing if it works. Note you can use the test PWM function to send particular frequencies out without having the vehicle running or driving to see if it works.\n\nYep. That is my plan. I just cant confirm if the EPS controller can accept 12V input for speed signal. Afraid i fried the controller LOL. Thus my plan is to either use voltage level shifter or simply use IGN/INJ output with 5V pullup resistor for speed signal.\n\nThe Aux outputs output a solid ground and a weak pullup to 12V not an actual 12v signal and so should be safe.\n\nAs a general rule, any electronics in a car is usually designed to be able to handle \"12V\", any input would typically have a clamp diode or series resistor to protect it.  We cant say that for certain for this particular device unless someone else has tried, but I can say I have never fried any automotive PWM device connected direct to a normal aux, including many fan controllers, fuel pump controllers and alternators that all used a 5V high level pwm originally.\n\nawesome thanks guys!\n\nReply to this topic...\n×\nPasted as rich text.\nPaste as plain text instead\nOnly 75 emoji are allowed.\n×\nYour link has been automatically embedded.\nDisplay as a link instead\n×\nYour previous content has been restored.\nClear editor\n×\nYou cannot paste images directly.

    "answer": "To connect your Link ECU:\n\n### Connecting via USB (G4X ECU)\n\n1.  **Connect the ECU to your laptop:** Use a Link G4X ECU USB Cable. This cable connects to the port labeled 'USB' on the ECU. No other adapter or cabling is required.\n2.  **Install USB Drivers (if first time):** If this is your first time connecting a G4X USB ECU, follow the driver installation instructions that appear. Select 'Continue Anyway' when prompted to install drivers.\n3.  **Start PCLink:** Double-click the PCLink icon on your Windows desktop.\n4.  **Provide power to the ECU:** Switch the vehicle's key to the ON position.\n5.  **Configure PCLink connection:**\n    *   In PCLink, go to the 'Options' menu and select 'Connection'.\n    *   In the connection options dialogue, select the correct COM Port number from the drop-down list or choose 'auto' for automatic detection.\n6.  **Establish connection:** Press the F3 key. PCLink will download settings from the ECU if the connection is successful. An error warning will appear if the connection fails.\n7.  **Verify connection:** Ensure PCLink shows “ONLINE” in the top right corner.\n8.  **Save changes (if any):** To permanently store any changes made to the ECU, press F4 before turning off the ECU's power.\n\n### Connecting via Wi-Fi\n\nThe provided official documentation does not detail a native Wi-Fi connection method for G4X ECUs. However, forum discussions suggest the following unofficial methods for remote or Wi-Fi connectivity:\n\n*   **USB over Wi-Fi for G4X:** Users have reported success using third-party hardware like a GL-iNET device flashed with Virtualhere USB software, powered by a 12V to 5V micro USB adapter, to extend the ECU's USB connection over Wi-Fi.\n*   **Remote Desktop for G4X:** Another method involves having a laptop with a 4G dongle connected to the ECU in the vehicle, and then accessing that laptop remotely via a second device (laptop or PC) using a remote desktop session.\n*   **Native Wi-Fi for G5 ECUs:** Forum posts indicate that newer G5 PCLinks support connecting over Wi-Fi natively. When connecting, PCLink may display available ECUs for selection.",

In terms of telemetry, I've built some kind of LoRa transmitter using an Arduino, within a CANBUS based system.

You can then start up a remote desktop session. If you got a good connection there shouldn't be must lag between the two devices.\n\nYou can use Virtualhere USB server on an android phone (ecu tuning cable plugs into phone USB port) but it is possibly a bit slow, The only time I have used it I had about 10Hz refresh rate in PC Link, not really adequate for tuning. That was with an old Samsung S5 that I had sitting around though, and I think from memory we only had 3g at that track too, so possibly a better phone with 4G would give better performance.\nA friend uses an intel NUC with a 4g dongle with remote desktop in an endurance car to monitor things, it works well.  Not a great video but you can see its quite responsive here:\nhttps://fb.watch/mLwQcWQReQ/\n\nReply to this topic...\n×\nPasted as rich text.\nPaste as plain text instead\nOnly 75 emoji are allowed.\n×\nYour link has been automatically embedded.\nDisplay as a link instead\n×\nYour previous content has been restored.\nClear editor\n×\nYou cannot paste images directly.

The unlock code was issued for this ecu in Aug 2019 so I expect it has already been unlocked.  Locked/Unlocked only relates to the ECU, not the map.\nPassword Protected:\nThe tuner can apply a password to the map in the ecu which prevents access and visibility to any ECU settings.  This protection only applies to the map, not the ecu.  You can load an un-password protected map into the ecu and it will be fully functional.\nSo its not 100% clear which of these you are talking about.  It sounds like you are talking about password protection in the first part of your post, then locked in the 2nd part.  Was the car running when you bought it?\nWith PC Link connected to the ecu, can you attach a picture of >Help>ECU Information and >Help>about.\n\nok, sorry for confusing you guys.\nTo make things simple.\n1. Car is running with links ecu plugged in for R53.\n2. the ecu itself is password protected by previous tuner.\n3. Without the password to the tune, i tried to put a fresh map over it by uploading the R53 links base map provided in the links softeare. Upon uploading the basemap, an error comes out saying that i would need to unlock this ecu with the serial code. Hence i am unable to overwrite the password protected map and start with a new one.\nthank you\nEdited\nOctober 22, 2024\nby Owner of miniR53 and evo 7\n\nOn 10/20/2024 at 10:18 AM, Adamw said:\nWith PC Link connected to the ecu, can you attach a picture of >Help>ECU Information and >Help>about.\n\nHi, i got myself connected to the ecu and did what was requested...\nafter that, i tried to reupload R53 basemap into the ecu and it worked... but it did say the ecu is disabled in a pop out like the attached below.\nthe error did not affect anything and the newly uploaded basemap can be accessible .\nbug ? i guess\n\nI think you might be using an old version of PC Link or possibly firmware that had a bug that could incorrectly report the lock status, which is why I keep asking for...\nOn 10/20/2024 at 10:18 AM, Adamw said:\nWith PC Link connected to the ecu, can you attach a picture of >Help>ECU Information and >Help>about.\nYou havent shown >help>about yet, so I still dont know for certain, but your ecu information shows that you are on a firmware from ~10 years ago so I would suggest you start by downloading the latest G4+ PC Link, and do a firmware update.  The latest is V5.6.8 for both PC Link and the firmware.  It should not disable the ecu by loading a fresh map in.\nLink to download:\nhttps://www.linkecu.com/pclink/PCLink G4+ EN-JP V5.6.8.3669 Setup.exe\n\nReply to this topic...\n×\nPasted as rich text.\nPaste as plain text instead\nOnly 75 emoji are allowed.\n×\nYour link has been automatically embedded.\nDisplay as a link instead\n×\nYour previous content has been restored.\nClear editor\n×\nYou cannot paste images directly.
